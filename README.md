## Technologies used

We have used many technologies to make our platform work good and add amaizing features.
1) We have used push notifications to notify employers whenever their projects get coatations, to notify freelancers with their coatation status, donation/tipping streaming incoming in their wallets.
2) We have integrated push chat, every user on our platform can communicate with each other.
3) We have used superfluid streams to manage tips/donations to the freelancers. Every user can support hardworking and under rated freelancers by sending a monthly tip to their account.
4) We have used chainlink to trigger automatic functions like finalize project after deadline ends.
5) We have deployed our contracts on polygon, filecoin, optisim, goerli, mantle to make it crosschain.

## Future Plans

1) We will be adding penalty system to make our platform more robust
2) We will also introduce web3 jobs on our platform where employers can hire freelancers for longer period work and payments will be automatically managed by superfluid.
3) We also want to focus on things which can make us revenue like commissions on every successful projects, commission on donation/tipping streams, etc. 
As we will be aiming for a production product in the coming future and we have many plans with quicklance
